Opportunities are available for everyone, all the way from students looking to learn to career scientists looking to fund dedicated open source time. Below are our major developer programs with more information on how to get involved.</p> <h2 id=google_summer_of_code ><a href="#google_summer_of_code" class=header-anchor >Google Summer of Code</a></h2> <p>The SciML organization is a partner organization for Google Summer of Code under the <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a> umbrella. In this summer program, students are paid to work on various SciML open source software repositories. Each of the students are paired with a team of mentors to teaching them various aspects of computational science, from numerical differential equations and scientific machine learning, to parallel and symbolic-numeric computing.</p> <p>To get started, take a look at the project lists and contact one of the mentors associated with the project.</p> <h4 id=projects_lists ><a href="#projects_lists" class=header-anchor >Projects Lists</a></h4> <ul> <li><p><a href="/gsoc/gsoc_numerics">General Numerics</a></p> <li><p><a href="/gsoc/gsoc_diffeq">Numerical Differential Equations and Stochastic Process Simulation</a></p> <li><p><a href="/gsoc/gsoc_sciml">Scientific Machine Learning</a></p> <li><p><a href="/gsoc/gsoc_symbolic">Symbolic-Numeric Computing</a></p> </ul> <h2 id=google_season_of_docs ><a href="#google_season_of_docs" class=header-anchor >Google Season of Docs</a></h2> <p>The SciML project is a participant organization for Google Season of Docs. In this program, technical writers are paid to work on various SciML open source documentation. Each of the writers are paired with a team of mentors to help them learn various aspects of computational science, from numerical differential equations and scientific machine learning, to parallel and symbolic-numeric computing.</p> <p>Check out the <a href="/gsod">SciML GSoD projects to learn more</a>&#33;</p> <h2 id=mlh_summer_fellowship ><a href="#mlh_summer_fellowship" class=header-anchor >MLH Summer Fellowship</a></h2> <p>The SciML organization partners with the <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">MLH Fellowship</a> to sponsor students over the summer for open source development. Check out the MLH Fellowship website for more information on getting involved.</p> <h2 id=numfocus_small_development_grants ><a href="#numfocus_small_development_grants" class=header-anchor >NumFOCUS Small Development Grants</a></h2> <p>Semi-quarterly NumFOCUS puts out a call for small development grants. The SciML organization puts out a call for proposals from the community for grant proposals. There are no restrictions on what the funding can be used for. Code development, documentation work, educational, sustainability, and diversity initiatives, or other types of projects are all eligible. Since only one application can be put in for the Julia project, an internal selection process is used to determine which proposals will be submitted to NumFOCUS. For examples of grants that have been funded and more information, see the <a href="https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants">NumFOCUS small development grants</a> page.</p> <p>Up to USD 10,000 is available per proposal. NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliated projects may receive upto two grants per year and can submit one application per cycle.</p> <p>If you are interested, please get in contact with Chris Rackauckas.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > Website powered by <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a> programming language. </div> <div class=copyright > Edit on <a href="https://github.com/SciML/sciml.ai">GitHub</a> </div> </div> </div>
