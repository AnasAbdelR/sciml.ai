# SciML is now an official NumFOCUS Sponsored Organization

SciML is now an [official NumFOCUS Sponsored Organization](https://numfocus.org/project/sciml).
We are excited about this change as it will allow a financial base for us to help
support developers interested in building open source software for scientific
simulation and scientific machine learning. To support the project, our developers,
and our future student programs, please
[donate to SciML through NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/donate-to-sciml)
