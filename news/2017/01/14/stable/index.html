This tag includes many new features, including:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/basics/integrator">The integrator interface</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/features/callback_functions">New Events/Callbacks API</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/tutorials/dde_example">Delay differential equation solvers</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/features/monte_carlo">Monte Carlo simulation methods</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/analysis/uncertainty_quantification">Uncertainty quantification</a></p> <li><p>Updated Developer tools &#40;benchmarking, etc.&#41;</p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/basics/plot">Greatly enhanced plot recipes</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/features/callback_library">A Callback Library</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/analysis/parameterized_functions">The new ParameterizedFunction constructor on arbitrary user-defined functions</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/solvers/ode_solve">CompositeAlgorithms</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/solvers/ode_solve">ODE.jl common interface bindings</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/solvers/ode_solve">More control over the Sundials solvers</a></p> </ul> <p>Over the last few months these changes &#40;among others&#41; have been part of a large feature expansion <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/6-months-differentialequations-jl-going/">which was laid out in a previous blog post.</a> While not entirely complete, the vast majority of API changes which were previously discussed are now complete &#40;only leaving out the choice of linear/nonlinear solvers, which is currently not available&#41;. Thus the API is pretty much set and I will be letting JuliaDiffEq have some time to stabilize its ecosystem. This means I will not be focusing on new features for awhile, and instead be working mostly on bug fixes, documentation, and applications. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl/issues">file an issue at the DifferentialEquations.jl repository</a>.</p> <p>A stable version of the documentation for v1.6.0 has also been tagged. While this shouldn&#39;t be too much of a big deal given that the API has stabilized, this means that users of previous versions will always have a documentation version which matches the package version they are using to better help long-term usage. Also, this is a good time for newcomers interested in the ecosystem to explore the code and its designs. See the <a href="https://sciml.ai/soc/ideas-page">Julia Google Summer of Code projects page</a> for some good beginner projects.</p> <p>We hope that this stable version gives everyone who is new to Julia and JuliaDiffEq some time to explore the ecosystem and start using it in various applications.</p> <hr /> <h2 id=immediate_future_directions ><a href="#immediate_future_directions">Immediate Future Directions</a></h2> <p>As noted above, for the immediate future development will be focusing on bug fixes and enhancing the documentation. In the meantime, I am working on publishing new algorithms for state-dependent delay equations and semi-stiff stochastic differential equations, along with better implementations of stiff solvers for ODEs. As these become available</p> <p>they will be added to the ecosystem. Other work throughout the ecosystem will be more internal, including:</p> <ul> <li><p>Automatic conversion/promotion of problems to expand the reach of each solver.</p> <li><p>More problem types: more DAEs, IMEX, 2nd order ODEs, Partitioned ODEs, and symplectic problems.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqDiffTools.jl">DiffEqDiffTools.jl</a> for more efficient usage of Jacobians</p> <li><p>Internals changes to allow for <code>Fun</code> types in <code>OrdinaryDiffEq.jl</code> methods</p> <li><p>An internals change of <code>StochasticDiffEq.jl</code> to be like <code>OrdinaryDiffEq.jl</code> and have the integrator interface</p> </ul> <p>For more details on these changes, <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/6-months-differentialequations-jl-going/">see this blog post</a>. None of these changes are expected to break user codes.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > Website powered by <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a> programming language. </div> </div> </div>
